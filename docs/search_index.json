A few things need to be checked before we start. First, we assume that you have either R or RStudio installed. The best way to learn is to follow along with your own laptop, but all are welcome. Weâ€™ll spend half the time with the lectures on the basic of R and data wrangling and half the time for you to try out wrangling yourself. You can also try some of the things you learn from the exercises on your own data. The goal of this course today is to equip you with the tools to take a (your) dataset and do the following: Import data to R and understand the structure of your data Look at it using summaries and descriptive statistics Engineer features relevant for your research Impute missing data To do transformation and understand what that means Plot the data using visually appealing and publish-ready figures Course schedule: Time Day1 Day2 9-10:30 Data-Wrangling, an introduction Modelling introduction and omics 10:35-12 Get your hands dirty with data-wrangling Your own catwalk with omics 13-14.30 GGplot2, an introduction Machine learning introduction 14.35-16 Plotting visually please plots Omics and machine learning This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
