## Packages required

The following packages are required. If you need to go back and check how installing a package is done see the section 3.5(#installpackages).   

library(dplyr).  
library(ggplot2).  
library(readr).  
library(tidyr).  
library(broom).  
library(palmerpenguins).  


This chapter will introduce you to data wrangling with an emphasis on the ``` dplyr ``` package along with other helpful functions. You will see how powerful wrangling can be and how it can be like a magic wand to transform data into your specific needs. The key functions include but are not limited to:        




``` {r, echo =FALSE, results = 'hide',message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
my_df <- data.frame(names =c("Villy","SÃ¸ren","Karl","Benny","Siri"),Grades= c(100,20,40,30,60))
my_df <- my_df %>% mutate(gender = c("boy","boy","boy","boy","girl"))
```

1. The overarching function which makes us able to combine functions and subsetting is **the pipe**. And what is a pipe? Pipes are a neat way to tie together several dataframes/functions into a chain of actions. It makes coding easier to understand and is therefore a better style of coding. It looks like this ```%>%```. For instance taking the mean of the first two rows of the ```my_df``` dataframe can be done like so:
``` my_df[1:2,"Grades"] %>% mean```. Learning to use the pipe to your advantage is learning to code. Luckily it all comes naturally when working with the following functions:


1.``` left_join()``` merge two data frames together using a key column. This function (along with its cousin functions ``` right_join()``` and ```join() ``` etc.) is the bread and butter of working with many data types that needs to be merged and analysed.

1. ``` mutate() ``` construct/reconstruct a column using a newly defined column name. This function is useful to generate a new columns that modify existing ones often using a conditional to do so.  

1. ``` count() ``` counts the n of each unique value in a column. Usefull to combine with mutate to see the counts of the newly constructed column.


1. ```arrange() ``` reorder the rows of a dataframe. For example, sort the rows of a dataset in descending order of the column height.   

1. ```filter() ``` the rows of a dataframe based on a filter, e.g. thresholds. It is similar to the example shown in the introduction, where we used old school filtering on my_df dataframe ``` my_df[my_df$names %in% c("Karl","Villy"),]```. Using the filter function and pipes you can do it like this: ``` my_df %>% filter(names %in% c("Karl","Villy"))```.

1. ```summarise() ``` a dataframe using one or more of its columns/variables with a summary statistic. Such examples could be the median or the mean and an example look like this: ```my_df %>% summarise(mean = mean(Grades))```. This function can be very powerful when combined with the ```group_by``` function.

1. ``` group_by() ``` is a dplyr way of grouping rows, it is a way to assign different rows to a group and do statistical reporting on every specific group in the data set. An example require us to add a third column to ``` my_df ``` like this:
``` my_df <- my_df %>% mutate(gender = c("boy","boy","boy","boy","girl")) ```. Now using this new ```my_df``` we can ```group_by``` on the gender column and calculate the median on this group:
``` {r}  
my_df %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(median(Grades)) 
``` 

## Using functions of the penguins dataset



## Load in a dataset from the internet

Open this link in a new tab by copy-pasting and save it to your computer using right-click (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/miniature-garbanzo/main/data/gapminder.csv). 
Save it as "gapminder2017".

### comma separated (csv)
try read it in using read csv, the file ending is automatically put on there, so even though you did not name it gapminder2017.csv, that is the name it will get.
```{r}
gapminder2017 <-read.csv("~/241023_phdcourse/data/gapminder2017.csv")
```

### table (can be anything that has table structure)
read.table

library(gapminder)

now load this dataset which has all the years, install it if you havent already

## Data types in R

Even though data types is a dull subject and therefore very hard to teach properly. It does serve an important purpose. Namely that you can figure out where error messages come from and which tools to use on which data 


Now lets show an example of this:
``` my_df[seq(1,3),] ```
